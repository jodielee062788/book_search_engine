## Description

This Book Search Engine project was motivated by the desire to create an intuitive and user-friendly platform for avid readers to search and keep track of new books they wish to purchase. 

### Problem Solving

The project solves the problem of searching for books by leveraging the Google Books API and allows users to save their favorite books to their account. 

### Learning

 Through this project, I learned how to integrate GraphQL with a MERN stack application and improve user experience by allowing users to perform various tasks.
